# openLuup-CarNet Plug-in
A plug-in to control your car via Volkswagen WE Connect (formerly CarNet). This code emulates a session on the WE Connect web site to obtain the car information and send commands.

This plugin has been tested on a PI running Debian with LuaSec updated to version 0.7.

You can control and monitor your Volkswagen just as you can do via the WE Connect portal and App. However, you can now control using all your Home automation logic. 

The ImperiHome cgi driver has been updated for special support for this CarNet plug-in to create a nice and functional pannel.

See this repository for an up to date python script to get data from your WE Connect/Car-Net enabled Volkswagen
